# PL SGMII

## **Design Summary**

This project utilizes AXI 1G/2.5G Ethernet Subsystem configured for SGMII. This has been routed to the SFP cage on SFP1 for use on a ZCU102 board. System is configured to use the ZCU102 si570 at 156.25MHz.

## **Required Hardware**

- ZCU102
- SFP module supporting SGMII

## **Build Instructions**

### **Vivado:**

Enter the `Scripts` directory. From the command line run the following:

`vivado -source *top.tcl`

The Vivado project will be built in the `Hardware` directory.

### **PetaLinux**:

Enter the `Software/PetaLinux/` directory. From the command line run the following:

`petalinux-build`

The PetaLinux project will be rebuilt using the configurations in the PetaLinux directory. To reduce repo size, the project is shipped pre-configured, but un-built.

Once the build is complete, the built images can be found in the `PetaLinux/images/linux/`
directory. To package these images for SD boot, run the following from the `PetaLinux` directory:

`petalinux-package --boot --fsbl images/linux/zynqmp_fsbl.elf --fpga images/linux/*.bit --pmufw images/linux/pmufw.elf --u-boot --force`

Once packaged, the `BOOT.bin` and `image.ub` files (in the `PetaLinux/images/linux` directory) can be copied to an SD card, and used to boot.
